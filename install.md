This document covers installing prebuilt Koja binaries and building the compiler from source on macOS and Linux. For a complete overview of the language, see the [language reference](/language/).

## Prebuilt binaries

Releases from v0.12.1 onward ship prebuilt binaries for macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) and Linux x86_64 (glibc), and releases from v0.14.1 onward add Linux arm64 (glibc). Each tarball contains the `koja` compiler and the `koja-lsp` language server. If you're on one of these platforms and don't plan to modify the compiler, this is the recommended path — no Rust or LLVM toolchain required.

### Via asdf (recommended)

```sh
asdf plugin add koja https://github.com/koja-lang/asdf-koja.git
asdf install koja latest
asdf set --home koja latest
koja --version
```

### Manual download

Read the newest version from the [release catalog](https://releases.kojalang.org), then grab the tarball and `.sha256` sidecar for your platform:

```sh
version=$(curl -fsSL https://releases.kojalang.org/latest)
curl -fLO "https://github.com/koja-lang/koja/releases/download/v$version/koja-v$version-darwin-arm64.tar.gz"
curl -fLO "https://github.com/koja-lang/koja/releases/download/v$version/koja-v$version-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sha256"
shasum -a 256 -c "koja-v$version-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sha256"
tar -xzf "koja-v$version-darwin-arm64.tar.gz"
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp "koja-v$version-darwin-arm64"/{koja,koja-lsp} ~/.local/bin/
```

(Use `sha256sum -c` on Linux, and substitute `linux-x86_64` or `linux-arm64` for `darwin-arm64`. To pin a release, set `version` yourself.)

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, then run `koja --version`.

### GitHub Actions

The [setup-koja](https://github.com/koja-lang/setup-koja) action installs the toolchain on Linux and macOS runners and adds it to `PATH`:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: koja-lang/setup-koja@v1
    with:
      koja-version-file: koja.toml
  - run: koja test
```

`koja-version-file` reads the version from `koja.toml` or `.tool-versions`, and `koja-version` pins one directly: an exact version, or a line like `0.18` that installs the newest matching release. The action also registers a problem matcher, so compile diagnostics annotate pull requests. See the [action README](https://github.com/koja-lang/setup-koja#readme) for all inputs.

### Docker

Images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are published to Docker Hub as [`kojalang/koja`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kojalang/koja) and to GitHub Container Registry as `ghcr.io/koja-lang/koja`. The image contains the compiler, the language server, and the tools that `koja` invokes:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app kojalang/koja koja run script.kojs
```

See [docker-koja](https://github.com/koja-lang/docker-koja#readme) for the tag policy and a multi-stage build example that deploys a compiled program on a plain base image.

## Building from source

On other platforms, or to work on the compiler itself, build from source as described in the sections below.

### Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer (1.94.1+ recommended — some transitive crates push the practical minimum upward; if you see MSRV errors, run `rustup update stable` or `rustup override set 1.94.1` inside the repo)
- LLVM 21 (specifically 21.1.x — `llvm-sys` will not accept other versions)
- A C toolchain (`cc` / `clang`)

The compiler links LLVM 21 statically through [`llvm-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys), so the LLVM development libraries must be installed and discoverable at build time.

#### Toolchain compatibility

Whatever installed your Rust toolchain also chose your `libstdc++`, and `llvm-sys` will static-link LLVM against that same `libstdc++`. Mixing ecosystems for those two pieces produces a hard-to-diagnose SIGSEGV deep inside the LLVM X86 backend the first time codegen runs. Stick to one of the coherent combinations:

| Rust source                   | LLVM source                       | Status                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Homebrew (macOS or Linuxbrew) | Homebrew (`brew install llvm@21`) | Supported                            |
| rustup                        | apt (`llvm-21-dev`)               | Supported, simplest on Debian/Ubuntu |
| rustup                        | Homebrew                          | Supported                            |
| Homebrew                      | apt                               | **Not supported**                    |

If you previously installed Rust via Homebrew and want to switch to apt LLVM, `brew uninstall rust` and reinstall via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) first.

### macOS (Homebrew)

This is the primary supported configuration.

```sh
brew install llvm@21
git clone https://github.com/koja-lang/koja && cd koja

export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix llvm@21)"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$(brew --prefix)/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"

cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix
cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix --release
cargo build --release -p koja-driver

cp target/release/koja ~/.local/bin/koja
codesign --force -s - ~/.local/bin/koja
```

The two-step `koja-runtime-posix` build is intentional: the driver's `build.rs` searches for `libkoja_runtime.a` in both the debug and release build directories. `codesign` is required on macOS so the kernel doesn't kill the binary on launch.

### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu — rustup + apt)

The simplest path on Linux. Rust comes from rustup (self-contained, doesn't link the system `libstdc++`), and LLVM comes from apt.
Install rustup if you don't already have it:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

Debian 12/13 and Ubuntu through 25.10 do not ship LLVM 21 in their own repos, so add [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org) first (skip this on Ubuntu 26.04+, where `llvm-21-dev` is native):

```sh
wget -qO- https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/llvm-snapshot.asc > /dev/null
codename="$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")"
echo "deb http://apt.llvm.org/$codename/ llvm-toolchain-$codename-21 main" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-21.list
sudo apt update
```

Install LLVM 21 and every dev dependency `llvm-sys` will need to link:

```sh
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential cmake pkg-config gdb \
    llvm-21-dev libpolly-21-dev clang-21 libclang-21-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libzstd-dev libtinfo-dev libxml2-dev libffi-dev libz3-dev
```

Pin `llvm-sys` to the apt-installed LLVM and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/koja-lang/koja && cd koja

export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX="$(llvm-config-21 --prefix)"

cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix
cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix --release
cargo build --release -p koja-driver

cp target/release/koja ~/.local/bin/koja
```

### Linux (Linuxbrew)

Use this path if your Rust toolchain also comes from Homebrew. The build flow mirrors macOS — `brew --prefix` resolves to `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` instead of `/opt/homebrew`.

```sh
brew install llvm@21
git clone https://github.com/koja-lang/koja && cd koja

export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix llvm@21)"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$(brew --prefix)/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"

cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix
cargo build -p koja-runtime-posix --release
cargo build --release -p koja-driver

cp target/release/koja ~/.local/bin/koja
```

### Verifying the install

```sh
koja run examples/hello.kojs
```

You should see `hello, world!` printed to stdout.

### Troubleshooting

#### `cannot find -lPolly`

Debian splits Polly out of the main LLVM package:

```sh
sudo apt install -y libpolly-21-dev
cargo clean -p llvm-sys
```

#### `cannot find -lz` / `-lzstd` / `-ltinfo` / `-lxml2` / `-lffi` / `-lz3`

LLVM 21 was built against these system libraries, and the linker re-resolves them when you link the compiler. Install whichever development package is missing:

| Linker arg | Debian package |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| `-lz`      | `zlib1g-dev`   |
| `-lzstd`   | `libzstd-dev`  |
| `-ltinfo`  | `libtinfo-dev` |
| `-lxml2`   | `libxml2-dev`  |
| `-lffi`    | `libffi-dev`   |
| `-lz3`     | `libz3-dev`    |

The full apt install line above pre-installs all of these.

#### `command not found: clang` (during `boring-sys` build)

`boring-sys` uses `bindgen`, which loads `libclang.so` to parse C headers. Install both:

```sh
sudo apt install -y clang-21 libclang-21-dev
```

For tooling consistency, match the LLVM version (`-21`) rather than installing the unversioned `clang` metapackage.

#### SIGSEGV inside `llvm::X86ReadAdvanceTable` when running `koja run`

You almost certainly have Homebrew Rust + apt LLVM (the unsupported combination from the toolchain compatibility table). Symptoms are a bare `Segmentation fault` with no Rust output, killing the host driver before it produces the user binary. `koja check` and `koja parse` succeed because they don't reach LLVM.

Confirm the diagnosis:

```sh
which rustc                                       # /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/rustc → bad
ldd ./target/release/koja | grep -iE 'brew|llvm'  # mixed paths → bad
```

Fix by collapsing to a single ecosystem. The cleanest is rustup + apt LLVM:

```sh
brew uninstall rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, if you want to stay on Linuxbrew, install Homebrew LLVM and remove the apt one:

```sh
brew install llvm@21
sudo apt remove --purge llvm-21-dev
unset LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

#### Stale `llvm-sys` artifacts after switching LLVM versions

`llvm-sys`'s build script does **not** rerun when you change `LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX`, so a `cargo build` after `apt install llvm-21-dev` reuses the previously-compiled artifacts and ignores the new install. Force a rebuild:

```sh
cargo clean -p llvm-sys
# or, if that doesn't take:
cargo clean
```

#### Type errors involving `*const i8` / `*mut i8`

Linux aarch64 (e.g. a Debian VM on Apple Silicon) defines `c_char` as `u8`, not `i8`. The repo's runtime crate uses `c_char` everywhere; if you see this in your own modifications, prefer `*const c_char` over `*const i8` in any FFI cast.

#### `dsymutil` warnings on Linux

Harmless — the macOS-only `dsymutil` invocation is gated out at compile time on Linux. If you see a stray reference, you're on stale source; pull and rebuild.
